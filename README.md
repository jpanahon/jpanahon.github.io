I am a mess that can utilize several programming languages and technologies. <br>
I am mostly self taught, but I would not consider myself proficient in any language as I am always learning. <br>
Not currently looking for any collaborators in my projects, but contributions are welcome. <br>
I don't mind if you fork my repositories, as long as you keep your fork open source. <br>
